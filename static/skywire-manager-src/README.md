# Skywire Manager

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

API requests are proxied to `http://localhost:8000` where the [manager process](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire#run-skywire) should be running.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
