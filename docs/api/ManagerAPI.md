v# Skywire Manager API Documentation
**Note: This document is a work in progress**

The following describes the Web API for the Skywire Manager (`manager`) application. You will need access to a running instance this application in order to utilise the APIs.

Examples provided below assume the Manager is running on the local machine (127.0.0.1). The default port for accessing the API is `8000`. 
All Node and Application keys have been deliberatly altered to ensure they are invalid.

## Manager API
The following API services are made avaiable by the Skywire Manager application (`manager`):
- [Manager](#manager)
    - [Login](#login)
    - [Check Login](#heck-login)
    - [Change Password](#update-password)
    - [Manager Node Request](#manager-node-request)
    - [Manager Term](#manager-term)
    - [Get Manager Port](#get-manager-port)
    - [Get Token](#get-token)
- [Connections](#run)
    - [Get All Connections](#get-all-connections)
    - [Get Manager Information](#get-manager-information)
    - [Get Node Information](#get-node-information)
    - [Set Node Configuration](#set-node-configuration)
    - [Get Node Configuration](#get-node-configuration)
    - [Save Client Connection](#save-client-connection)
    - [Remove Client Conneciton](#remove-client-connection)
    - [Edit Client Connection](#edit-client-connection)
    - [Get Client Connection](#get-client-connection)

### Login
Login (authenticate) to the Manager. This is the equivelant of logging into the Manager from the Web UI and is a pre-requisit for a number of other API calls.

Successfuly calling this API will setup an authenticated session with the Manager, and a session cookie will be provided back to the caller as part of the response payload. The session cookie is required as input to a number of other APIs.

The password must be provided as the value for the `pass` parameter.
The following validation is performed on the value provided for `pass`:
- Not less than 4 or larger than 20 characters. The call will return `false` if this condition is not met.
- Compares a hashed version of the provided password against the stored password hash. If they are not the same the service will return `false`.

#### Usage
```
URI: /login
Method: Post
```

Example:
```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/login" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' \
     --data-urlencode "pass=example-password"
```

```
Example:
```sh
## Manager - checkLogin
curl -X "POST" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/checkLogin" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' \

```

### Update Password

Both the old and new passwords must be provided as values for the `oldPass` and `newPass` parameters.
The following validation is performed on both values, with errors returned of the validation fails:
- Not less than 4 or larger than 20 characters.
- The new password is not the system default password.
- The old (current) password is correct.
- The new password is successfully saved.

Note that the current authenticated session is destroyed when the password is changed. You will need to re-authenticate with the manager using the new password.s

```

Example:
```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/updatePass" \

### Manager Node Request
Asks the Manager to perform an API request for one of its connected Nodes. Use the `/conn/getNode` API to obtain the `IP` and `Port` for the Node you wish to call an API for.

Note: You must have logged in to the Manager using `/login` before calling this API.

Set the following parameters on the request:
- `addr` = URI of the Node API to be called
- `method` = The HTTP method to be used. This must be either GET or POST (default if not provided)


#### Usage
```
URI: /req

* Type (`string`) - The connection type. Can be either `TCP` or `UDP`.
* SendBytes (`unit64`) - The number of bytes that have been sent to this node.
* RecvBytes (`unit64`) - The number of bytes that have been received by this node.
* LastActTime (`int64`) - The last time the Manager recieved an Acknowledgement from the Node.
* StartTime (`int64`) - The time the Node was started.
